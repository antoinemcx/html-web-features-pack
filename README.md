A pack of some Web Features (HTML, CSS, JS) that I made and wanted to make open-source.  
If you like the project, feel free to put a ‚≠ê ; If you need help or anything, join my [discord server](https://discord.gg/G6WQsMQShZ).  


## How to find the bots I'm looking for ?

You need to click on the Branches button (image attached) and then select a project [![Branches](https://i.imgur.com/TPu0KUX.png)](https://github.com/antoinemcx/html-web-features-pack/branches)

## What you need to know

The code of the different features are not commented much, you have to **understand the code before using it**.
Indeed, copying code without making it your own is completely useless ; thank you in advance for your understanding !
