# 1. Image Slider

### Preview
<img src="https://github.com/antoinemcx/html-web-features-pack/blob/1.-Image-Slider/preview.jpg">

### Responsive
This slider is responsive, but beware : when the screen size decreases, the image size adapts (**object-fit: cover**), so it's up to you if you prefer to do otherwise.

### Non-native tools used
- Fontawesome (for the previous & next buttons)
